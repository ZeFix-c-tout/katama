# check-display

check-display is a lightweight utility designed to assist with simple everyday tasks.  
It allows you to quickly identify which display is connected and which user profile is currently active on the system.  
This tool was developed as an early prototype, mainly for experimentation and learning purposes, and should not be considered a fully stable or production‑ready application.
